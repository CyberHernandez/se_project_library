# Project 1: Practicum Library

The Practicum Library webpage is the first project in the Software Engineer program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a design brief. Now that I have gone through more coding lessons I realize how elementary this assignment was and I look forward to really having fun with it once I return to it with mad tricks up my sleeve. 

## Project features
